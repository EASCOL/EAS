- EAFIT staff can manage and administrate studentsâ€™ reservations.

## How to run the server yourself
At this point you may have been curious on how the application is run.

### Main requirements are listed here:
- [NodeJS 20.11.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) or later
- Python 3.11 or later
- MongoDB 7.0.7 or later

### Language-specific requirements:
For Python, you will need:
- Django 5.0.3 or later
- Django REST framework 3.14.0 or later
- Pymongo 4.6.2 or later

The front-end side is managed with **[React](https://react.dev)**, using **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)** as a building tool. `Package.json` is already included on the project, so by using `npm install` inside `eas_site/react_site` should suffice for all used packages.

To start the front-end-side client, go to `/eas_site/react_site` and use `npm run dev` to start the development server.

The server-side is managed with **[Python](https://www.python.org)**, using **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)** as the backend framework and **[Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)** for API calls via REST. It is **strongly recommended** to use **virtualenv** for this project, or even in general when working with Django projects, as it creates a sandbox with unique configurations separated from global configurations and avoiding unexpected behaviors.

To start the server-side client, go to `/eas_site` and use `python manage.py runserver`.

Database is managed with **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**, using **[Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** as a server-side package on Python for communication and data manipulation.
